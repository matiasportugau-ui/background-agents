# Background Agents

A framework for building and managing autonomous background agents that can perform various tasks without human intervention.

## Overview

This repository contains tools and frameworks for creating background agents that can:
- Monitor systems and applications
- Perform automated tasks
- Process data in the background
- Integrate with various APIs and services
- Scale horizontally across multiple instances

## Features

- **Agent Framework**: Core framework for building autonomous agents
- **Task Scheduling**: Built-in scheduling and task management
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance monitoring
- **Integration**: Easy integration with external services
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling

## Quick Start

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install globally to use from anywhere
./install-global.sh

# Or install via npm
npm install -g .

# Now you can use bg-agents from any directory
bg-agents init                    # Initialize in current directory
bg-agents init /path/to/project   # Initialize in specific directory
bg-agents create monitor          # Create a monitor agent
bg-agents start                   # Start agents
```

### Local Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the agent framework
npm start

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

## CLI Commands

Once installed globally, you can use the `bg-agents` command from anywhere:

```bash
# Project Management
bg-agents init [path]           # Initialize background agents in a project
bg-agents start [path]          # Start background agents
bg-agents stop [path]           # Stop background agents
bg-agents status [path]         # Show agents status

# Agent Management
bg-agents create <name> [path]  # Create a new agent
bg-agents list [path]           # List available agents

# Installation
bg-agents install               # Install CLI globally
bg-agents help                  # Show all commands
```
